Name:~"Wood Duck, female
Aix sponsa"
Habitat:~Wooded swamps, ponds, rivers, and shallow lakes surrounded by deciduous forest
In the scene:~Though many birds haven't yet started to nest, this female wood duck has spent the past month incubating her clutch of eggs inside the hollow basswood tree. The ducklings hatched yesterday and this morning they are leaving the nest. After they have all jumped from the nest hole, the female will lead them to water where to feed on aquatic insects.
Did you know?:~Wood ducks nest high up in tree cavities. Their chicks are unharmed when they fall to the ground thanks to downy feathers and flexible skeletons.
Classification:~Duck, goose, and swan family (Anatidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Wood Duck, male
Aix sponsa"
Habitat:~Wooded swamps, ponds, rivers, and shallow lakes surrounded by deciduous forest
In the scene:~With iridescent feathers, a red eye ring, and red and yellow bill, the male wood duck is one of the most beautiful water birds in North America. The male takes no role in incubating eggs or caring for the young.
Did you know?:~Males migrate with females. They pair up with during the winter, and females largely determine wood duck migratory patterns.
Classification:~Duck, goose, and swan family (Anatidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"White-Crowned Sparrow
Zonotrichia leucophrys"
Habitat:~Scrubby habitat in boreal forests, forest edges, thickets, and a variety of other brushy habitats
In the scene:~This bird is passing through on its way to breeding habitat far to the North or West. It nests in the Arctic, on the ground in brushy or weedy habitat. Its white and black-striped head is similar to the much more common white-throated sparrow.
Did you know?:~White-crowned sparrows are well known for their song dialects, which evolve over time and throughout their geographic range in a way similar to dialects in human language.
Classification:~New World sparrow family (Passerellidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Swainson's Thrush
Catharus ustulatus"
Habitat:~Spruce forests and dense streamside woodlands
In the scene:~This bird stopped here to refuel on its long migration from the tropics to its nesting habitat in the boreal forest. Like other thrushes, it feeds on the ground, scraping up leaves to find insects, worms, and snails. Its brown back and spotted breast provide camouflage while among the leaf litter.
Did you know?:~Like many songbirds, Swainson's thrushes migrate at night, singing distinctive notes that can be heard overhead during nights with favorable winds.
Classification:~Thrush family (Turdidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Rose-Breasted Grosbeak, female
Pheucticus ludovicianus"
Habitat:~Open deciduous forests, orchards, and other mixed, young forests
In the scene:~Though the male is bright red, black, and white, the female looks like a large, brown sparrow with an overgrown beak. For most of the year, grosbeaks use their large beaks to feed on fruits and seeds. During spring and early summer, they raise their young on insects.
Did you know?:~Though this species is often hard to spot in the forest canopy, it makes itself known with its lyrical song.
Classification:~Cardinal-grosbeaks (Cardinalidae), a lineage of 42 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Rose-Breasted Grosbeak, male
Pheucticus ludovicianus"
Habitat:~Open deciduous forests, orchards, groves, and other mixed, young forests
In the scene:~Despite being dramatically colored with black, white, and red, male rose-breasted grosbeaks often stay high in leafy trees where they are hard to spot. But they are easily identified by their lovely song.
Did you know?:~Male rose-breasted grosbeaks take a turn incubating eggs during the day. Females incubate in the evening, through the night, and in the morning.
Classification:~Cardinal-grosbeaks (Cardinalidae), a lineage of 42 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Black-and-White Warbler
Mniotilta varia"
Habitat:~Breeds in deciduous and mixed forests; winters in tropical forests
In the scene:~This little black, white, and gray bird feeds by creeping along tree trunks looking for insects hiding in bark crevices. Here, it explores cracks in a sugar maple tree.
Did you know?:~Black-and-white warblers are among the first birds to arrive back at the breeding grounds after winter, and are one of the most aggressive.
Classification:~Wood warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"American Redstart, male
Setophaga ruticilla"
Habitat:~Young forests, river groves, and edges of deciduous and mixed woodland
In the scene:~Male American redstarts are black above with bright orange spots on sides, wings, and tail. As they feed, they flash their bright tails and wing spots, flushing out insects that are then often caught on the wing. Like most other warblers, redstarts winter in Central and South America.
Did you know?:~Like redstarts, many different taxonomic groups of birds around the world forage by flashing bright patches, making this foraging strategy an example of convergent evolution.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"American Redstart, female
Setophaga ruticilla"
Habitat:~Young forests, river groves, and edges of deciduous and mixed woodland
In the scene:~Like a muted version of the male, female American redstarts are gray on top with yellow spots on their sides, wings and tail.
Did you know?:~American redstarts have relatively flat bills surrounded by long rictal bristles (like whiskers) around their bills for catching insects, and a large wing area, all adaptations to pursuing insect prey in flight.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Ovenbird
Seiurus aurocapilla"
Habitat:~Near the ground in broadleaf forests, especially in large stands of mature trees
In the scene:~With its olive-brown back and spotted breast, this warbler looks like a little thrush. Like thrushes, ovenbirds feed on insects and other invertebrates in the leaf litter of deciduous forests. More often heard than seen, its loud, rapid-fire "teacher-teacher-teacher" song rings through the spring forest.
Did you know?:~Ovenbirds nest on the ground and build a rounded cover of grasses and leaves. The domed nest looks like an old-fashioned outdoor oven, for which it is named.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Least Flycatcher
Empidonax minimus"
Habitat:~Open forests, aspen groves, and orchards, generally in deciduous or mixed forests
In the scene:~One of eleven species of small flycatchers that all look very much the same. All are gray with white wing-bars and eye-rings. The best way to tell these birds apart is by their song and habitat. Least flycatchers nest in open woodlands and have a snappy little song -- "chebeck!" Flycatchers sit upright on branches and take flight to catch insects in mid-air.
Did you know?:~Least flycatchers complete their entire breeding season in only about 65 days, which reflects how little time their preferred prey are available in the northern summer.
Classification:~Tyrant-flycatcher family (Tyrannidae), one of the most diverse bird families
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Tennessee Warbler
Oreothlypis peregrina"
Habitat:~Deciduous and mixed forest, bogs, swamps, and edges of young forests
In the scene:~Looking up into the tree canopy, it's hard to find this dull olive-green and gray bird. A white stripe through its eye is about the only distinctive mark. Though they are hard to see, their songs fill the woods for a week or so each spring when they stop here on their way to nest in the boreal forests. There, they feast on insects, especially spruce budworms.
Did you know?:~Tennessee warblers are often nectar thieves in their tropical wintering grounds, piercing flowers from below without pollinating them.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Chestnut-Sided Warbler
Setophaga pensylvanica"
Habitat:~Second-growth deciduous forest, forest edges, and overgrown fields
In the scene:~With its yellow cap, black and white face, and reddish-brown stripe, you can't mistake the chestnut-sided warbler. Its song is also distinctive, an emphatic "please, please, pleased to meet you." It nests in young aspen, birch, and other deciduous trees.
Did you know?:~Probablydue to increased logging, this species is far more common today than in the early 1800s, when John James Audubon reported seeing only one.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Blackburnian Warbler 
Setophaga fusca"
Habitat:~Breeds in boreal forest; winters in tropical montane forest
In the scene:~A flaming orange throat and black and orange face make this bird a favorite for birdwatchers to spot during its spring migration from South America to the North Woods.
Did you know?:~The Blackburnian warbler is the only North American warbler with an orange throat.
Classification:~Wood warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Magnolia Warbler
Setophaga magnolia"
Habitat:~Coniferous forests when breeding in the north; tropical montane forest during the winter
In the scene:~To identify this bird, look for the bright yellow throat and breast with a necklace of black stripes running down the sides. It is often easier to spot then other warblers because it stays low in shrubs and short trees. Magnolia warblers nest in young spruce and other conifer trees. Their numbers may be increasing since it favors forests that are regenerating after lumbering or fires.
Did you know?:~This species was named in 1810 by Alexander Wilson for the magnolia tree in which he found it.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher
Polioptila caerulea"
Habitat:~Open forests and thickets, especially with oaks and pines
In the scene:~This little gray bird with a long, white-edged tail flits about the treetops while singing its whining call. Though it doesn't usually eat the gnats for which it is named, it migrates north to feast on spring and summer insects.
Did you know?:~Rushing to beat the clock in the short northern summer, blue-gray gnatcatchers sometimes speed up nest-building by re-using materials from their old nests.
Classification:~Gnatcatcher family (Polioptilidae), which includes 15 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Eastern Chipmunk
Tamias striatus"
Habitat:~Mature deciduous or mixed forests with a relatively open understory
In the scene:~This chipmunk has spent most of the winter hibernating in its burrow under this old basswood tree. During hibernation, it wakes up periodically to feed on stores of nuts gathered in the fall. In the spring, it feeds on buds, seeds and fruits. But these cute little rodents can also be aggressive predators, stealing eggs and young birds from nests.
Did you know?:~Chipmunks spread the seeds of trees and also the spores of fungi.
Classification:~Sciuridae, one of the families of rodents
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Mourning Cloak Butterfly
Nymphalis antiopa"
Habitat:~Woodlands, parks, and suburban areas, especially near rivers
In the scene:~One of the few butterfly species that can over-winter as adults, mourning cloaks are usually the first butterflies to be seen in early spring. They are often found sunning themselves. Their velvety-brown wings absorb the heat of the sun so they can be active even when air temperatures are still cool.
Did you know?:~Mourning cloaks feed primarily on tree sap, especially from oaks, but they also feed on rotting fruit and small amounts of nectar.
Classification:~Nymphalidae, the largest family of butterflies, consisting of around 6,000 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Blue-Winged Warbler
Vermivora cyanoptera"
Habitat:~Stream and woodland edges, brushy hillsides, bogs, and dry uplands
In the scene:~Hard to find despite a bright yellow head and undersides, this warbler also has blue-gray wings and a black eye stripe. Blue-winged warblers have expanded their range northward, possibly in response to climate change. Their song is a buzzy "beeee-BZZZZZ."
Did you know?:~As the range of this species expands northward, it has begun to encroach on golden-winged warbler territories. The two warblers often compete and even interbreed.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Red-Bellied Woodpecker
Melanerpes carolinus"
Habitat:~Woodlands, orchards, suburbs, and groves, especially in riverside deciduous forest
In the scene:~Look for this woodpecker on tree trunks in hardwood forests. Its red belly is rarely seen, but the red on the top and back of the head, and black and white stripes on its back, are good field marks. As the climate has warmed, this adaptable bird has expanded northward and into suburban areas.
Did you know?:~Red-bellied woodpeckers often cache nuts by wedging them into crevices in tree bark or wood high above the ground.
Classification:~Woodpecker family (Picidae), which includes 254 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Pileated Woodpecker
Dryocopus pileatus"
Habitat:~Coniferous or mixed woodlands, especially in large undisturbed tracts
In the scene:~With the extinction of the ivory-billed woodpecker, this is the largest woodpecker in North America. Look for the large red crest and all-black back. Pileated woodpeckers need woods and forests with large trees. They often chisel out large holes near the base of rotted trunks to feed on carpenter ants or the larva e of wood-boring beetles.
Did you know?:~Pileated woodpecker holes can be so immense that they kill or even topple trees.
Classification:~Woodpecker family (Picidae), which includes 254 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Great Blue Heron
Ardea herodias"
Habitat:~Marshes, swamps, shores, tidal flats, or any body of freshwater
In the scene:~The big, beautiful bird standing near the quiet shoreline is patiently watching for fish, frogs, or large insects to move. It will snap them up with a quick jab of its sharp beak. Great blue herons are skilled predators and will sometimes stalk voles and other rodents on land.
Did you know?:~The variable diet of this species allows it to winter further north than most other aquatic birds -- even in areas where most water freezes.
Classification:~The heron and egret family (Ardeidae), which includes 64 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Cerulean Warbler
Dendroica cerulean"
Habitat:~Mature, deciduous forests with a high canopy, especially in river valleys
In the scene:~Look high in the trees to find the blue and white cerulean warbler. They only nest in tall, mature hardwood forests -- Minnesota is at the northwest edge of their range. As forests in eastern North America have been fragmented into separate patches, cerulean warblers have declined. Forest edges allow cowbirds to find and parasitize the warbler's nests, reducing reproduction.
Did you know?:~In their South American wintering grounds, cerulean warblers often join mixed-species foraging flocks, feeding alongside resident tropical birds.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Mourning Warbler
Geothlypis philadelphia"
Habitat:~Undergrowth, thickets, forest openings, and brush
In the scene:~Like many warblers, this bird is olive green on top and yellow underneath. Look for a dark gray hood with a black edge on the breast. Mourning warblers nest in shrubs, thickets, and blackberry tangles that grow up after forest fires and timber harvests. This one is perched on an elderberry, one of the first shrubs to bloom in the spring.
Did you know?:~After mourning warbler eggs hatch, nesting females eat the shells to recapture calcium from them.
Classification:~Wood-warbler family (Parulidae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Basswood
Tilia americana"
Habitat:~A variety of habitats, from moist, lowland floodplain forests to drier, upland areas
In the scene:~Along with sugar maples, basswoods are one of the most common trees in hardwood forests. Their heart-shaped leaves are just emerging on the higher branches, but the leaves are bigger and more mature on the shoots around the base of the tree. Basswoods often regenerate from the base of older, dying trees, forming clumps that lean out from the same base, as seen in the background.
Did you know?:~Because basswood lumber is lightweight and easy to work, it is often used by woodcarvers to make decoys and decorative bird carvings.
Classification:~Mallow family (Malvaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Pagoda Dogwood (also known as Alternate-Leaved Dogwood)
Cornus alternifolia"
Habitat:~Acidic, slightly moist soils in full sun to partial shade
In the scene:~This small tree grows in the shade of the larger maples and basswoods. The branches grow out in tiers resembling the rooftops of Asian temples (pagodas). Here, its leaves are already fully grown and clusters of small white flowers are about to open.
Did you know?:~Unlike other dogwoods, this species bears leaves in an alternating pattern along the stem.
Classification:~The dogwood family (Cornaceae), which includes roughly 85 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Sugar Maple
Acer saccharum"
Habitat:~Full sun to partial shade in moist, slightly acidic soil
In the scene:~Sugar maples are one of the most important trees of the northern hardwood forest. They can grow over 30 m (100 ft) tall and live 400 years. This one is still quite small, but has already survived some trauma. Its lower trunk is twisted and there's a dead spot further up that's now slowly healing over. Its leaves are still small and reddish in color. Sugar maples are one of the few trees that can reproduce in the shade of a mature forest. Look on the forest floor to find some maple seedlings.
Did you know?:~Maple syrup is a multi-billion dollar industry in the U.S. and Canada.
Classification:~Soapberry family (Sapindaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Ironwood
Ostrya virginiana"
Habitat:~Full shade to full sun in average to dry soil, especially in upland areas and wooded bluffs
In the scene:~This shade-tolerant tree grows under the canopy of larger maples, basswoods, and oaks. Look for clusters of flowers that hang down below the newly emerged leaves. It's also known as "hophornbeam," because its fruits are similar in shape to hops. It is a slow growing tree with extremely hard wood.
Did you know?:~Tolerant of shady conditions, ironwood trees produce long horizontal branches.
Classification:~The birch family (Betulaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Large-Flowered Trillium
Trillium grandiflorum"
Habitat:~Partial to full shade in rich, fertile forests
In the scene:~"Tri" is Latin for three -- this plant has three leaves, three green sepals and three petals. The white petals turn pink as they age. Trilliums take a long time to mature, and may not flower for several years.
Did you know?:~The seeds of trillium are dispersed by ants.
Classification:~Bunchflower family (Melanthiaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Snow Trillium
Trillium nivale"
Habitat:~Partial to full shade in rich, fertile forests
In the scene:~The smallest trillium in Minnesota, at only 8-10 cm (3-4 in) tall, this is one of the earliest flowers to bloom, sometimes when patches of snow are still on the ground. Like other trillium, they have three leaves and flower parts in multiples of three.
Did you know?:~This plant is a tiny understory species with little ability to compete for light, so it completes most of its annual growth before leaves in the forest canopy have developed.
Classification:~Bunchflower family (Melanthiaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Dwarf Trout Lily
Erythronium propullans"
Habitat:~Partial to full shade in rich, fertile forests
In the scene:~The dwarf trout lily is native to only three counties in southeastern Minnesota -- it's found nowhere else on earth. Because of its rarity, the dwarf trout lily is on the federal endangered species list.
Did you know?:~This species is thought to have evolved in southeastern Minnesota soon after the retreat of glaciers around 11,000 years ago. Its range has spread little because it does not produce seeds.
Classification:~Lily family (Liliaceae), which includes around 700 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Nodding Trillium
Trillium cernuum"
Habitat:~Full shade in acidic woodland soils
In the scene:~Look for the plant with three leaves on a tall stem and a flower that droops down instead of facing up.
Did you know?:~Like several other spring wildflowers, trilliums have fat globules attached to their seeds. These attract ants, who carry them back to their nests. After the fat is eaten, the seeds are dumped in the ant midden -- a good place for the seeds to grow.
Classification:~Bunchflower family (Melanthiaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"White Trout Lily
Erythronium albidum"
Habitat:~Full shade in moist, fertile forests
In the scene:~Trout lilies are among the first to flower in the spring and prefer moist areas. Their name comes from the spotted leaves that resemble the spots of brook trout.

Classification:~Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Jack-in-the-Pulpit
Arisaema triphyllum"
Habitat:~Full shade in moist forests
In the scene:~Jack-in-the-pulpit's flowers are located along a finger-like club hidden within a leaf-like hood. Plants are either male or female, but can change gender from year to year.
Did you know?:~Jack-in-the-pulpit's musty odor tricks fungus gnats into visiting. While looking for a place to lay their eggs, the gnats inadvertently pollinate the flowers.
Classification:~Arum family (Araceae), which includes the immense corpse flower.
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Canada Lily of the Valley
Maianthemum canadense"
Habitat:~Full shade in forest habitats
In the scene:~This is a native plant, unlike lily of the valley, which was introduced. It is found in forests throughout Minnesota. The flower buds are just forming and will bloom later.
Did you know?:~The genus name maianthemum means "may flower," denoting the fact that these plants produce flowers in May.
Classification:~Asparagus family (Asparagaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Adam-and-Eve Orchid
Aplectrum hyemale"
Habitat:~Wet bottomland forests and wooded swamps
In the scene:~Each plant has just one elliptical, pointed leaf with distinctive parallel veins. Look for the foot-tall dried stalks from last year's flowers. The leaves appeared in the fall and survived the winter to harvest sunlight in early spring, when the trees above are leafless. The leaves will wither as new flower stalks appear in late spring.
Did you know?:~This species can fertilize its own flowers in the absence of pollinators.
Classification:~Orchid family (Orchidaceae), one of the largest flowering plant families
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Large-Flowered Bellwort
Uvularia grandiflora"
Habitat:~Full shade in moist woodlands
In the scene:~This very common spring wildflower grows in small clumps. Its leaves and yellow flowers look droopy, but they are not wilted. The leaves expand after flowering and persist into the summer.
Did you know?:~Deer favor this species as foliage to browse. As a result, this species tends to decline in areas of deer overpopulation.
Classification:~Flame lily family (Colchicaceae), which includes almost 300 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Large-Flowered Bellwort
Enemion biternatum"
Habitat:~Full shade in deciduous forests
In the scene:~There's nothing really false about this plant. It is one of several species of early spring flowers with delicate stems and leaves, and small white flowers. Look for three leaflets and flowers with five petals.
Did you know?:~This species can produce small colonies from their rhizomes, underground stems that store carbohydrates.
Classification:~Buttercup family (Ranunculaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Dutchman's Breeches
Dicentra cucullaria"
Habitat:~Full shade in rich, fertile woodlands
In the scene:~Named for flowers that look like tiny, white billowy pants hanging upside down. This is one of the first plants to flower and one of the first to fade. The finely divided leaves are still bright green, but will soon turn brown. Within a few weeks, no sign of this plant will remain, except for its fruit.
Did you know?:~The root system of this species produces small edible tubers resembling tiny potatoes.
Classification:~Poppy family (Papaveraceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Sharp-Lobed Hepatica
Anemone acutiloba"
Habitat:~Full shade in deciduous or mixed woodlands
In the scene:~This low-growing plant has small white or lavender flowers in early spring. The leaves start out green, turn reddish brown in the fall, and persist through the winter. They wither as the plant begins to bloom in spring. Look for both new green leaves and old brown leaves.
Did you know?:~These leaves are poisonous and moderately camouflaged, protecting the plant from herbivores.
Classification:~Buttercup family (Ranunculaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Downy Yellow Violet
Viola pubescens"
Habitat:~Full shade in dry, upland forests
In the scene:~Look for broad heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers with five petals. There are many species of violets that are hard to identify, but this is the only yellow violet that blooms in spring woodlands in Minnesota.
Did you know?:~Like many understory species, the downy yellow violet blooms as early as March to soak up the sun before the trees leaf out and fill the forest canopy.
Classification:~The violet family (Violaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Blue Violet
Viola sororia"
Habitat:~Shade to full sun in forests, roadsides, fields, or lawns
In the scene:~This is one of the common violets that can be found growing almost anywhere in Minnesota. Violet seeds are often dispersed by ants who carry the seeds back to their nests. This violet under a fallen log might be growing where an ant colony once made a nest.
Did you know?:~The blue violet is the state flower of four states: Illinois, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Rhode Island.
Classification:~Violet family (Violaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Virginia Bluebells
Mertensia virginica"
Habitat:~Full shade in moist, rich soils, especially in floodplain forests
In the scene:~Clusters of trumpet-like blue flowers make this one of the loveliest spring flowers, and some forests are covered with big patches of blue in early spring. But the beauty doesn't last long. Like many spring wildflowers, bluebells are ephemeral -- their flowers and leaves die back as forest trees leaf out and block the sunlight.
Did you know?:~This species is often found in gardens, but is difficult to market at garden stores because of the short period of time the plants have foliage.
Classification:~The borage family (Boraginaceae), which includes about 2,000 species
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Wild Ginger
Asarum canadense"
Habitat:~Full shade in rich, moist woodlands
In the scene:~The big heart-shaped leaves of wild ginger grow from rhizomes that spread under the leaf litter. Look near the base of the leaves to find a three-pointed, reddish, cup-shaped flower. It's growing near the ground for a reason -- wild ginger is pollinated by flies and slugs that live in the leaf litter.
Did you know?:~In spite of the name, this species is not related to the well-known culinary and medicinal ginger.
Classification:~Birthwort family (Aristolochiaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Bloodroot
Sanguinaria canadensis"
Habitat:~Full shade in moist forests
In the scene:~Most of these bloodroot plants have already flowered -- note the green fruits on long stems. A few are still showing flowers with long white petals and yellow pollen. The big distinctively-shaped leaves continue to grow after the flowers have faded. They will persist into the summer if they get enough light and moisture.
Did you know?:~Broken stems, leaves, and roots ooze a red juice, which is where the name bloodroot comes from.
Classification:~Poppy family (Papaveraceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Virginia Waterleaf
Hydrophyllum virginianum"
Habitat:~Full to part shade in moist woods and floodplain forests
In the scene:~Deeply-divided leaves with toothed edges give this plant a fern-like appearance. Waterleaf thrives in rich, moist, forest soils where it can form dense stands. Clusters of lavender flowers appear later in the spring.

Classification:~Phlox family (Polemoniaceae)
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Spring Beauty
Claytonia virginica"
Habitat:~Full shade in moist woodlands
In the scene:~The small pink flowers and narrow leaves of spring beauty can carpet the forest floor. But the show doesn't last long. The flowers and leaves quickly fade as the overhead trees leaf out. Even under snow, the dormant plants can detect the lengthening daylight of late winter. Their leaves and flower buds start to expand under the snow as spring approaches.
Did you know?:~This species grows tiny, potato-like tubers that taste somewhat like chestnuts.
Classification:~Miner's lettuce family, Montiaceae, a newly classified plant family
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Scarlet Cup
Sarcoscypha coccinea"
Habitat:~Decaying hardwood twigs and branches in damp spots on the forest floor
In the scene:~The bright red cup-shaped fruiting bodies are small and hidden in the leaf litter on the forest floor. Fungi play a vital role in breaking down dead organic matter and recycling nutrients.
Did you know?:~Scarlet cup is one of the first fungi to appear early in the spring, a flash of bright color on the forest floor.
Classification:~Sarcoscyphaceae, a family of cup fungi
Distribution:~
~
Name:~"Black Urn
Urnula craterium"
Habitat:~Decaying hardwood twigs and branches in damp spots on the forest floor
In the scene:~These are the spore-producing parts of a fungus that is decaying this dead log. Spores are dispersed as raindrops splash into the cups. This same fungus is parasitic on oaks, but will only produce cups on dead wood that has fallen to the ground. This same species produces chemicals that inhibit the growth of other fungi.
Did you know?:~Black urn fungi generally grow at the same time as morels, so their emergence tells morel hunters it's time to go out and forage.
Classification:~Sarcosomataceae, a family of cup fungi
Distribution:~
